## Deliverables
- [ ] TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) with appropriate settings
- [ ] TailwindCSS installed and configured
- [ ] TailwindCSS config file with desktop-only settings
- [ ] Basic styling utilities ready for use

## Technical Notes

- No external design system libraries
- Desktop-only responsive design
